#In this updated example, I've added the bernoulli function, which is called within the binomial function. The bernoulli function takes a probability p as input and returns True if a random value generated using random.random() is less than p, indicating success. Otherwise, it returns False.

#The binomial function remains the same as in the previous example. It iterates n times and checks if each trial is successful using the bernoulli function. If a trial is successful, the successes counter is incremented by 1. After completing all the trials, the function returns the total number of successes.

#Finally, the code calls the binomial function with n=10 and p=0.5 and prints the result, which represents the number of successes for 10 trials with a success probability of 0.5.
