#n this example, we use the t function from the scipy.stats module to generate random values following a Student's t-distribution. The generate_highest_paid_african_americans function takes the number of highest paid African Americans to generate as a parameter.

#Inside the function, we define the degrees of freedom, which represents the shape of the t-distribution. You can adjust this value based on your requirements. We then loop through the desired number of influencers and generate a salary using the t.rvs function. The loc parameter sets the mean salary, and the scale parameter adjusts the standard deviation.

#The generated salaries are stored in a list and returned as the result. In the example usage, we generate 5 highest paid African Americans and print their salaries.

#Please note that the generated salaries in this example are random values from a Student's t-distribution. The values may not correspond to actual salary figures for highest paid African Americans in the real world.
